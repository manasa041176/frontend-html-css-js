            Greater equal to >=, Less than <, Less than or equal to <=

            3.	Bitwise Operators => Bitwise AND &, Bitwise OR |, Bitwise XOR ^, Bitwise NOT ~, Bitwise Left Shift <<, 
            Bitwise Right Shift >>, Bitwise Right Shift with Zero >>>

            4.	Logical Operators => Logical AND &&, Logical OR ||, Logical Not ! 

            5.	Assignment Operators => Assign =, Add and Assign +=, Subtract and assign -=, Multiply and assign *=, Divide and assign /=, Modulus and assign %=
